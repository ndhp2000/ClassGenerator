# ClassGenerator
<h3> Create a C++ class with Setter, Getter, Constructor, Destructor. </h3>
To run this file, just open CMD, then jump into the Folder you want to create Class. 
Type this Command Line:  <br/>
CG.exe "Your input file" "Name of your Class" <br/>

Please note that your Input-File must have the structure as follow: 
  - The first line is the name of your class (without any special characters)
  - Every next line is started with the data type followed with names of variables (every word must be seperated by some spaces and not contain any special characters.)
  - You can see an example in Input.txt.
  
P.S: This is just for doing assignments in my University, so the code is really crazy and chaotic (TT Please don't judge me on that sh**). You can edit it to match your coding convention.
